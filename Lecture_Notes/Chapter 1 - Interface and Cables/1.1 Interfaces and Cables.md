### 1. Ethernet Standards

| Speed    | Common Name      | IEEE Standard | Informal Name | Maximum Length |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| 10 Mbps  | Ethernet         | 802.3i        | 10BASE-T      | 100 m          |
| 100 Mbps | Fast Ethernet    | 802.3u        | 100BASE-T     | 100 m          |
| 1 Gbps   | Gigabit Ethernet | 802.3ab       | 1000BASE-T    | 100 m          |
| 10 Gpbs  | 10 Gig Ethernet  | 802.3an       | 10GBASE-T     | 100 m          |

* **BASE** refers to baseband signaling.
* **T** refers to twisted pair.

#### 1.1 Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP) Cables

+ **Unshielded** means that the cables is not protected by metalic shield, which make them vulnerable to electrical interference.
+ **Twisted** means that the cable is twisted to provide protection against Electromagnetic Interference (EMI), there are **8 cables twisted together to make 4 Pairs**.

+ There are **8 pins** in the RJ-45 connector similar to the **4 pairs**. However, not all protocols use all 8 pins, **10BASE-T, 100BASE-T use 2 pairs** and **1000BASE-T, 10GBASE-T** use 4 pairs.

  <figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Full-Duplex</figcaption>


+ The use of UTP Cables facilitates Full-Duplex connection, as when a connector connected to the port, **there are 4 pins that can be used for transmission and receival**. So **message can be sent using pin 1, 2 and message can be received using pin 3, 6.**

>[!Note] As this is a connector connecting to a port
> A pair can only be used for transmission or receival. If 1, 2 is used for transmitting, it cannot be used for receiving at the same time.

 <figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Straight-throuth</figcaption>

+ **Router and PC** use pin 1, 2 for transmission, pin 3, 6 for receival. whereas, **Switch** use pin 1, 2 for receival, pin 3, 6 for transmission. Therefore, when we connect a **Router or a PC** to a **Switch** we use `Straight-through cable`. Which is a cable that `directly connect the Tx of 1 end to the Rx of the other end`.

+ This can not apply for the connection between **Router to a PC** or a **Router to another Router** or **a PC to another PC**. As the `Tx of one end can not connect to the Tx of another end`.

>[!Success] In such situation we will use the `cross-over cable`
>Cross-over cable allows for the connection of same device where pins of Tx and Rx must be different.

>[!Success] Problems caused by this rarely happens because of `Auto MDI-X`
>`Auto MDI-X` is a technology that auto-detect the Rx or Tx of the neighbour device and adjust the Rx and Tx of itself, which will **allow the use of Straight-through cable** even if it is the same device type.

<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">1000 and 10G</figcaption>

+ 1000BASE-T and 10GBASE-T is much faster not only because it uses 4 pairs, but also because each pair is bidirectional, meaning it can switch between Rx and Tx when needed.

#### 1.2 Fiber-Optic Connections

<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Fiber optic</figcaption>

+ In the picture above, the switch and router does not only have RJ-45 interface, but also some weird interface that can be connected.

![[fiber optic cable.png| 600]]
<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Fiber optic cable</figcaption>

+ So a fiber optic connection would require **an interface**, **a SFP transceiver** and **a Fiber optic cable** to facilitate fiber optic connection. Opposite from the UTP cabling, which uses different pins on the same cable for Tx and Rx, `Fiber optic connection use different wire for different connection type, hence the two cable in the picture above.`

![[fiberoptic connection.png| 600]]
<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Fiber optic connection</figcaption>

+ The fiber optic cable consists of 4 parts.

![[Fiber Optic structure.png| 600]]
<figcaption style="text-align: center;font-weight: bold;">Fiber optic structure</figcaption>
+ Fiber optic cable has 2 modes: `Single mode and multi mode`. Multimode fiber has wider core than single-mode, allowing for longer cables than UTP cable, but shorter cables than sing-mode fiber. Which means the `multimode is cheaper than the single mode`.

| Informal Name | IEEE Standard | Speed  | Cable Type               | Maximum Length |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| 1000BASE-LX   | 802.3z        | 1 Gbps | Multimode or Single Mode | 550m -> 5km    |
| 10GBASE-LR    | 802.3ae       | 10Gbps | SingleMode               | 10km           |
| 10GBASE-ER    | 802.3ae       | 10Gbps | Singlemode               | 30km           |
| 10GBASE-SR    | 802.3ae       | 10Gbps | multimode                | 400m           |
