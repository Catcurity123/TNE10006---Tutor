`Situation 1: a computer connects with another computer using wired cables in the same network.`

Computer A perform data encapsulation with its application layer (L7, L6, L5) and it needs to transmit this data to Computer B. For this data to be sent, Computer A need to know:

+ Computer B’s IP address (which is L3 scheme): this can be done by pinging B’s IP address or B’s domain name.

+ Computer B’s MAC address (which is L2 scheme): this can be done using ARP (address resolution protocol).

This can be illustrated with the picture below:

**The process of A’s figuring out B’s MAC address:**

1.    As A knows B’s IP address, A can send ARP Request to ask for the MAC address associated with B’s IP address.

2.    This Request will also include A’s MAC address as B’s also doesn’t know A’s MAC address. However, as A doesn’t know B’s MAC address, it cannot send the ARP directly to B, instead, the ARP Request is a Broadcast meaning that it is send to every device in the local network. (Broadcast MAC address is ffff.ffff.ffff). Step 1 and 2 is illustrated with the picture below:

3.    ARP Mapping are stored in an ARP Cache, which is a table that store devices’ IP addresses and their according MAC addresses. After received A’s ARP Request, B can now populate its ARP Cache with A’s MAC address and send back to A an ARP Response. Note this the ARP Response is Unicast meaning that it is send directly to A as B already has A’s IP address and MAC address. The process can be illustrated with the picture below:

4.    Once A receive the ARP Response, it can populate its ARP Cache with B’s MAC address. This will mean that A has everything it needs to perform communication with B and the data will be sent.
