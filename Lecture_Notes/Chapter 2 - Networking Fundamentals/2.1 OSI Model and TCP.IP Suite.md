 **Layer 1  - Physical Layer - Transporting Bits**
 + L1 Technologies: Cables, Wifi, Repeaters, Hubs
 + Cables including RJ-45 UTP cable for Ethernet, Coaxial cables, Fiber Optics cables.
 
**Layer 2 - Data Link - Hop to Hop
+ Interacts with the Wire, including NIC - Network Interface Cards or Wifi Access Card.
+ `Addressing Scheme - MAC addresses`: 48 bits, represented as 12 hex digits. 
+ 94-65-9C-3B-8A-E5 (Windows) - 94:65:9C:3B:8A:E5 (Linux) - 9465.9C3B.8AE5 (Cisco)
+ Every NIC has a unique MAC address
+ L2 Technologies: NICs, Switches

**Layer 3 - Network - End to End**
+ `Addressing Scheme - IP Addresses`: 32 bits, represented as 4 octets, each 0-255
+ L3 Technologies: Routers, Hosts, (anything with an IP)

**Layer 4 - Transport - Service to Service**
+ Distinguish data streams
+ `Addressing scheme - Ports`: 0-65535 - TCP, 0-65535 - UDP
+ Clients select random port for each connection.

**Layer 5 - Session - Distinguish `user session`**
+ L4 distinguish service session from application from one user, but if the system support multi-user then how can it distinguish two user using the same apps?
+ L5 identifies a user independent from L2, L3, or L4 addresses.
+ L5 Technologies: `Cookies`

**Layer 6 - Presentation - How to interpret the 1s and 0s**
+ L6 Technologies: `Ascii Encoding, PNG, MP3`
