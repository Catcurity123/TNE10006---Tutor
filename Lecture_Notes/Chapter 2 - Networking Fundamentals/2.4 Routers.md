+ Routers are connected to a network and have IP address and a MAC address
+ Routers forward packets not destined to themselves
+ Router maintain a map of all the Networks they know about called `Routing Table`

Routing Table can be populated via **three** methods:
+ Directly Connected - Routes for the Networks which are attached.
+ Static routes - Routes manually provided by an Administrator
+ Dynamic routes - Routes learned automatically from other Routers

`Note that:`
+ Routers have `Routing Tables - map of every network` and also have `ARP Table - mapping of L3 to L2 address` 
+ `Routing table` needs to be populated initially so as to facilitates networking as if it is empty the router will simply drop the packet
+ `ARP table` starts out empty and will be populated when data flow through.

#### Routers typically connected in a hierarchy 
+ So that they are easier to scale - more consistent connectivity.
+ And Hierarchy allows for `Route Summarization`
