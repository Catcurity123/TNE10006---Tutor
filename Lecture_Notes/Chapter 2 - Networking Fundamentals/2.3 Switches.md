+ Switching is the process of moving data within networks.
+ Switches use and maintain `MAC Address Table`, which is a mapping of `Switch Ports to MAC addresses`.
+ Switches will perform three actions: `Learn, Flood, Forward`

`Learn`: Update MAC Address Table with mapping of Switch Port to Source MAC
`Flood`: Duplicate and send frame out all switch ports (except receiving port)
`Forward`: Use MAC Address Table to deliver Frame to appropriate switch port.

`Note that:`
+ Traffic going through the switch is different from traffic going to the switch.
+ If Traffic is going through the switch then the MAC address and the IP of the switch will not be involved as it will only perform 3 actions above using the MAC Address Table.
+ If Traffic is going to the switch then the switch act as a host and every rule applied to a host will be the same to the switch.

+ `Unicast Frame`: is when destination MAC is another host
+ `Broadcast Frame`: is when destination MAC is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
