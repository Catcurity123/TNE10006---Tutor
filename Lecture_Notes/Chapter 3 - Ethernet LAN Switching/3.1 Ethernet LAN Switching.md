#### A. Ethernet Frame

![[Pasted image 20231219132426.png]]

1. **Preamble:** 7 bytes of alternating 1's and 0's, which aalows devices to synchronize with their receiver clocks. `=> 10101010 * 7`

2. **SFD:** Start Frame Delimiter with 1 byte that marks the end of the preamble, and the beginning of the rest of the frame. The byte pattern of this field is `10101011`

3. **Destination and Source :** Indicate the devices sending and receiving the frame. These fields consist of the destination and source `MAC Address`. Each of these fields carries 6 bytes.

4. **Type or Length:** 2 bytes field. If a value is 1500 or less, it will indicate the **LENGTH** of the encapsulated packet. However, if the value is larger than 1536, it indicates the **TYPE** of the encapsulated packet. 

> The Type is usually IPv4 or IPv6, `IPv4 = 0x0800` and `IPv6 = 0x86DD`.

5. **FCS:** Frame Check Sequence contains 4 bytes that detects corrupted data by running `CRC algorithm` => Cyclic Redundancy Check Algorithm.

`Note that:`
+ The `Preample + SFD` is usually not considered part of the Ethernet header, therefore the size of Ethernet header + trailer is 18 bytes.
+ The minimum size for an Ethernet frame `Header + Payload[Packet] + Trailer` is 64 bytes. Therefore, the minimum payload (packet) size is 46 bytes.
+ If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added.
+ The maximum size of Ethernet frame is 1518 bytes

#### B. MAC Address
- 6 bytes physical address assigned to the device when it is made, hence, BIA (Burned-In Address). It is also globally unique.

- The First 3 bytes are the OUI(Organizationally Unique Identifier), which is assigned to the company making the device.

- The last 3 bytes are unique to the device itself.

#### C. ARP - ADdress Resolution Protocol
- ARP is used to discover the Layer 2 address (MAC address) of a known Layer 3 address (IP address)

- Consist of two message:
  1. `ARP Request` is a broadcast message that ask for the designated MAC address.
  2. `ARP Reply` is a unicast message sent from the designated recipent to the ARP's sender.
