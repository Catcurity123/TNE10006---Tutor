#### A. Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP)
(+) DTP is a Cisco proprietary protocol that allows Cisco switches to `dynamically determine their interface status (access or trunk)` without manual configuration.
(+) DTP is enabled by default on all Cisco switch interfaces and present an IT Security risk, manual configuration is recommended and DTP should be disabled on all switches

(+) A switchport in `dynamic desirable` mode will actively try to form a trunk with other Cisco switches. It will form a trunk if connected to another switchport in the following mode: `switchport mode trunk` or `switchport mode dynamic desirable` or `switchport mode dynamic auto`
	(-) Therefore, if two switches connected together and one of them enable the interface to be `trunk` the other will also be trunk if it is in `DTP`.

(+) `switchport mode trunk`: manually configure trunk with other interfaces.
(+) `switchport mode dynamic desirable`: actively forming trunk with other interfaces.
(+) `switchport mode dynamic auto`: passively forming trunk with other interface, meaning that if the connected switches is in `dynamic desirable` it will form a trunk, but if the other is in `dynamic auto` it will not form a trunk.
(+) `switchport nonegotiate` or `switchport mode access`: disable DTP.

`NOTE`
(+) DTP will not automatically form trunk with routers and PCs, in such cases, manual configuration is required.

#### B. VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)
(+) VTP allows configuration of VLANs on central VTP server switch, and other switches (VTP clients) will synchronize their VLAN database to the server.
(+) This is designed for large networks with many VLANs, so that we dont have to configure each VLAN on every switch.

(+) There are 3 VTP modes: `server`, `client`, and `transparent`

(+) `VTP Servers` is enable by default, switches in this mode can `add/modify/delete` VLANs. VLAN database is stored in non-volatile RAM(NVRAM).
	(-) `VTP Servers` has a `revision number` that will increase every time a VLAN is added/modified/deleted to keep the latest version of VLAN database.
	(-) `VTP Servers` will advertise the latest version of the VLAN database on trunk interfaces, and `VTP Clients` will synchronize their VLAN database to it.

(+) `VTP Clients` cannot add/modify/delete VLANs. They do not store VLAN database in  VNRAM (in VTPv3, they do). They will synchronize their VLAN database to the server with the highest revision number in their VTP domain.

(+) `show vtp status`: show the status of the switch vtp
(+) `vtp domain Cisco`: configure the vtp domain, effectively enable vtp on the switch.
	(-) `Note that:` if a switch with no VTP domain (`domain NULL`) receives a VTP advertisement with a VTP domain name, it will automatically join that domain.

`NOTE`:
(+) `VTP` is generally not used in modern network, as if a network sync their VLAN database with another network, this coul result in the shutdown of the whole network as mismatches in VLAN database could occur.

(+) `VTP Transparent mode:` does not participate in the VTP domain (does not sync its VLAN database), it will maintains its own VLAN database in NVRAM, it can add/modify/delete VLANs, but wont be advvertising to other switches
(+) It will, however, forward VTP advertisement that are in the same domain as it.
