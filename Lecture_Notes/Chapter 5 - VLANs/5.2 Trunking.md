#### A. Trunk port and dot1q
(+) `Trunk ports` is used to carry data from multiple VLANs using one interface
	==> This is possible because Switches will tag all frames that they send over a trunk link, allowing the receiving switch to know which VLAN the frame belong to.

(+) There are two main trunking protocols: `ISL (Inter-Switch Link)` and `IEEE 802.1Q or dot1q`

(+) The 802.1Q tag is inserted between the Source and Type/Length fields of the Ethernet Frame.

	==> The tag is 4 bytes (32 bits) in length consists of two main fields: `Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)` nad `Tag Control Information (TCI)`
		==> `TCI` can also be divided into 3 fields `PCP`, `DEI`, and `VID`

(+) `Tag Protocol Identifier (TPID)` is always set to a value of `0x8100` which indicates the frame is 802.1Q tagged.
(+) `Priority Code Point (PCP)` is 3 bits in length, and is used for Class of Service (CoS), which prioritizes important traffic in congested networks.
(+) `Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI)` is 1 bit in length, and is used to indicate that the frame is eligible for dropping for more important frame in congested networks.
(+) `VLAN ID (VID)` is 12 bits in length, this is the most important field in dot1q tag as it identifies the VLAN the frame belongs to. 
	==> As this is 12 bits therefore, VLAN can varies from 0 -> 4095, but `0 and 4095 are always reserved` so there are only 4096 usable VLANs.

(+) The range of VLANs (1-4094) can be divided into 2 range:
	- Normal VLANs range: 1 - 1005
	- Extended VLANs range: 1006 - 4094
	==> Some old devices may not recognize extended VLANs range/

#### B. Native VLAN
(+) 802.1Q has a feature called `native VLAN` which ISL does not have. `Native VLAN` is VLAN 1 by default on all trunk ports, however, this can be manually configured on each trunk port

(+) The switch does not add an 802.1Q tag to frames in the native VLAN. When a swicch receives  an untagged frame on a trunk port, it assums the frame belongs to the `native VLAN`. It is very important that the native VLAN matches
 
`NOTE`
(+) This is important as `native vlan` wont have VLAN tag, so if there is a mismatch, the switch will discard the frame. Consider the following example

```
PC A in VLAN 10 sends frame to PC B in VLAN 30 through 2 switches.
+ The first switch has VLAN 10 as native VLAN, the second has VLAN 30. So when the frames travels through switch 1 it will not be tagged, when the frames arrives at switch 2, because it does not have vlan tag, the switch wont forward it onto VLAN 30 and vice versa.
```


(+) For security purposes, it is best to change the native VLAN to an `unused VLAN`, and to make sure the `native VLAN` matches between switches

#### C. Layer 3 (Multiayer) Switches 
(+) A Multilayer switch is capable of both switching and routing, it is `Layer 3 aware`
(+) We can assign IP addresses to its interfaces, like a router.
(+) `Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVIs)` are the virtual interfaces we can assign IP Addresses to in a multilayer switch, we can configure each PC to use the `SVI` (Not the router) as their gateway address.
