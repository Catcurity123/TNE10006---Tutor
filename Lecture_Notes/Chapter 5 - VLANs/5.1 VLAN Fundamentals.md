(+) `VLAN` stands for Virtual Local Area Network

#### A. Local Area Network
(+) Standard definition is that LAN is a group of devices in a single location, but a more specific definition is: A LAN is a single `broadcast domain`, including devices in that `broadcast domain`

==> `A broadcast domain` is the group of devices which will receive a broadcast frame (destination MAC of `FFFF.FFFF.FFFF`) sent by any of its member.

#### B. Virtual Local Area Network
(+) VLANs are configured on switches on a `per-interface` basis which will logically separate end hosts at Layer 2

(+) Switches do not forward traffic directly between hosts in different VLANs.
